/**

 * 
 * A pipeline is basically a socket : it allows to abstract
 * efficiently the transactions between two hosts.<br />
 * <br />
 * As almost every component of this project, we're using an
 * observer pattern in order to listen the messages coming
 * from the pipeline.<br />
 * <br />
 * Three kinds of event can be emitted :<br />
 * <br />
 * - Pipeline.Event.Connection<br />
 * - Pipeline.Event.Disconnection<br />
 * - Pipeline.Event.Command<br />
 * 
 * @toc Pipeline.Base
